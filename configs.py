    #### Intro
    \nThe GMP Library is a platform to share where you can find materials for a specific 
    course and find materials already shared by your others.  
    \nThe purpose of this platform is to allow those of us who are good at finding
    where digital resources are located at to help others who are not.\
    \n#### Example
    \nSuppose Tintin knows URL link of where to find the PDF for *Critique of Pure Reason*, 
    which is a book requested by a Philosophy course. 
    \nTintin can upload the link as follows for everyone else to see: 
    \n> **Library ‚û°Ô∏è Add to Database ‚û°Ô∏è Add Material**
    \nTintin is now a hero for sharing!
    \n#### Ready to Search or Contribute?
    \nHead to üìö [Library](/Library) now!

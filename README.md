# Garreg Mach Project
An open-source project with the goal of reducing costs associated with higher education, one step at a time.

## Current Platforms
### 📚 Library
#### Intro
The GMP Library is a platform to share where you can find materials for a specific 
course and find materials already shared by others.  

The purpose of this platform is to allow those of us who are good at finding
where digital resources are located at to help others who are not
#### Example
Suppose Tintin knows URL link of where to find the PDF for *Critique of Pure Reason*, 
which is a book requested by a Philosophy course. 
Tintin can upload the link as follows for everyone else to see: 

> **Library ➡️ Add to Database ➡️ Add Material**

Tintin is now a hero for sharing!

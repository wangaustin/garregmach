# Garreg Mach Project
An open-source project with the goal of reducing costs associated with higher education, one step at a time.

## Current Platforms
### üìö Library
#### Intro
The GMP Library is a platform to share where you can find materials for a specific course and find materials already shared by others.

The goal of the GMP Library is for students who are good at finding the locations of digital resources to help those who are not. The goal of the GMP Library is for students who are good at finding the locations of digital resources to help those who are not. This way, students will hopefully need to spend less money on physical copies of the academic resources simply because they could not find them online.

Note that the GMP Library database does not store any files at all. It is purely a repository of links.
#### Example
Suppose Tintin knows URL link of where to find the PDF for *Critique of Pure Reason*, 
which is a book requested by a Philosophy course. 
Tintin can upload the link as follows for everyone else to see: 

> **Library ‚û°Ô∏è Add to Database ‚û°Ô∏è Add Material**

Tintin is now a hero for sharing!

#### Isn't This LibGen? What's So Different about GMP Library?
LibGen is absolutely awesome! However, it can get a bit difficult to find what you need there for a particular course.

The GMP Library asks people to add links to academic resources in association with a particular course. This mandatory association is what sets it apart from other resource sharing websites such as libgen, as it allows the system to easily filter queries.

So, if I only want to see the resources for the Modern Philosophy course at Vanderbilt University taught by Dr. Wuerth, for instance, the system can efficiently query that. This kind of association also adds another layer of filtering as it has presumably been deemed related to this course by the original uploader.
